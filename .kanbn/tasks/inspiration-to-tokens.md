# Inspiration to Tokens

The Inspiration block can be used for more than just "re-roll d20 test". It can represent "I choose when to use this" bonus; DM inspo, Bardic inspo, and custom are the ones that come to mind.

Custom e.g. - some games have flashback mechanics (see EXU Kymal) where a player can choose to use a token to "flashback" and RP something they did previously to grant them some tool they have now in the present (using the token converts it into a previously unnamed aid).
