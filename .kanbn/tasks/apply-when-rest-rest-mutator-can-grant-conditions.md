These conditions have a "duration" (e.g. are removed on next rest)

Open Hand Monk "Tranquility"
- "Sanctuary" spell has a condition that it grants
- Grant the same condition when a long rest ends (which goes away when a long rest is taken)

Devotion Paladin "Purity of Spirit"
- "Protection from Evil and Good" spell has a condition that it grants
- feature ensures that the character always has that condition (cannot be removed)
